# Open Annotation Tool

A helper module that is script and possibly cli based. Users get simple functionality to annotate the open energy ontology when filling out metadata in the [oemetadata](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata) format. The oemetadata provides specific fields to annotate the open energy ontology.

The keys are subjeys of ressources.schema.fields. The key names are:

- `is_about`
- `value_reference`

The Open Annotation Tool provides similar functionality to the Oemetadata Builder found on the Open Energy Platform website. However, it is designed to quickly add/edit a values to multiple files.
